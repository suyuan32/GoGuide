Digital certificates verify the online credentials and identity of individuals or organizations, and let network users and recipients know that the data they enter will go to a trusted source. They are similar to security badges for websites and users, and help ensure the security of the Internet.</p><p>Digital certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) for encrypting online data. Digital certificates are also known as public key certificates or identity certificates. For example, TLS/SSL certificates have two purposes: to encrypt and protect data transmitted between websites, browsers, and web servers, and to help identify and verify the owner of the website.</p><p>The basic architecture of a digital certificate is Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which uses a pair of keys to implement encryption and decryption. The keys include a private key and a public key. The private key is mainly used for signing and decryption, is user-defined, and is known only to the user; the public key is used for signature verification and encryption, and can be shared by multiple users.</p><p>The application of digital certificates is very wide. For example, using digital certificates in secure email can construct secure email certificates, mainly for encrypting the transmission of emails, protecting the security of emails during transmission and reception. In addition, digital certificates can also be used for terminal protection. For example, if a digital certificate is installed during the process of e-commerce activities, then even if its account or password and other personal information are stolen, the information and financial security in its account can still be effectively guaranteed.</p><h4 id="how-digital-signature-works" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-digital-signature-works"><span>How Digital Signature Works</span></a></h4><figure><img src="'+e+'" alt="signature" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>signature</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>Signature Process</p></blockquote><ol><li>Use the signature hash algorithm (such as <code>sha256</code> <code>md5</code>) to calculate information including the issuer&#39;s information, the certificate holder&#39;s information, the certificate validity period, the certificate holder&#39;s public key, etc. (as in the example of <code>x.509</code>), to generate a certificate digest <code>α</code>.</li><li>The issuer generates a pair of private and public keys, then uses the private key to encrypt the fingerprint, and the encrypted data is the issuer&#39;s digital signature <code>γ</code>.</li><li>Attach the digital signature <code>γ</code> to the digital certificate to form a signed digital certificate.</li><li>The issuer gives the signed digital certificate and the public key to the certificate holder.</li></ol><blockquote><p>Verification Process</p></blockquote><ol><li>The user obtains the signed digital certificate through some means (for example, browser access), and after parsing, the digital signature <code>γ</code> and the digital certificate can be obtained.</li><li>The user uses the fingerprint algorithm in the digital certificate to recalculate the relevant content of the digital certificate, generating a new fingerprint <code>β</code>.</li><li>At the same time, the user uses the obtained issuer&#39;s public key to decrypt the digital signature, and obtains the decrypted fingerprint <code>α</code>.</li><li>Compare the two fingerprints <code>α</code> and <code>β</code>.
