General network devices have a size limit for the ARP table. Attackers forge a large number of ARP messages with changing IP addresses, making the ARP table unable to add new entries, thus preventing normal communication <br><br> 2. When attackers use tools to scan host segments or cross-segment scans, they will send a large number of messages to the device that the target IP cannot resolve, causing frequent ARP Miss errors, generating a large number of temporary table items, and broadcasting a large number of ARP request messages to request IP resolution, causing high CPU usage</td><td>1. <strong>ARP Message Rate Limiting</strong> <br> Deploy ARP message rate limiting function at the gateway, which can count the number of ARP messages within a certain period of time. If it exceeds the threshold, it will be discarded, thereby reducing the load on the device.<br> 2. <strong>ARP Miss Message Rate Limiting</strong> <br> Similar to ARP message rate limiting, limit ARP Miss messages <br> 3. <strong>Strict ARP Table Item Learning</strong> <br> The function of strict ARP table item learning means that the device only learns the response of its own ARP request and does not accept the ARP request sent by other devices. 4. <strong>ARP Table Item Limiting</strong> <br> Limit the number of dynamic table items in the ARP table. If it exceeds, it will no longer learn new table items.</td></tr><tr><td>ARP Spoofing Attack</td><td>Attackers send forged ARP messages to maliciously modify the ARP table items of network devices, thereby causing communication abnormalities</td><td>1. <strong>ARP Table Item Solidification</strong> <br> After receiving the ARP message for the first time, do not allow the ARP table item to be modified, thereby preventing malicious modification.<br> 2. <strong>Free ARP (Free ARP)</strong> <br> The gateway actively sends ARP messages with its own IP address as the target address to the host, regularly updates the MAC address in the host&#39;s ARP table, thereby preventing the user&#39;s messages from being sent to the incorrect gateway.</td></tr></tbody></table>',12),a=[s];function n(i,c){return d(),e("div",null,a)}const u=t(r,[["render",n],["__file","5-arp.html.vue"]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/en/guide/concepts/network/5-arp.html","title":"ARP","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"order":5,"title":"ARP","icon":"line-md:star-filled","head":[["meta",{"name":"keywords","content":"ARP, Network Protocol, MAC Address, IP Address, ARP Attack, ARP Spoofing"}],["link",{"rel":"alternate","hreflang":"zh-cn","href":"https://goguide.ryansu.tech/guide/concepts/network/5-arp.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://goguide.ryansu.tech/en/guide/concepts/network/5-arp.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Go Guide"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"ARP"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Introduction The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is an important protocol in IPv4 that is used to determine the MAC address of a target device based on its IP address, ensurin..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale:alternate","content":"zh-CN"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-05-05T13:24:21.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"Go Guide"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-05-05T13:24:21.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"ARP\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-05-05T13:24:21.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Go Guide\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://github.com/suyuan32\\"}]}"]],"description":"Introduction The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is an important protocol in IPv4 that is used to determine the MAC address of a target device based on its IP address, ensurin..."},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Introduction","slug":"introduction","link":"#introduction","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"ARP Packet","slug":"arp-packet","link":"#arp-packet","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Working Principle","slug":"working-principle","link":"#working-principle","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Common ARP Attack Methods","slug":"common-arp-attack-methods","link":"#common-arp-attack-methods","children":[]}],"git":{"createdTime":1708165156000,"updatedTime":1714915461000,"contributors":[{"name":"Ryan Su","email":"yuansu.china.work@gmail.com","commits":6}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":4.75,"words":1425},"filePathRelative":"en/guide/concepts/network/5-arp.md","localizedDate":"February 17, 2024","autoDesc":true,"excerpt":"<h2>Introduction</h2>\\n<p>The <strong>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</strong> is an important protocol in IPv4 that is used to determine the MAC address of a target device based on its IP address, ensuring the correct delivery of data.</p>\\n<div class=\\"hint-container tip\\">\\n<p class=\\"hint-container-title\\">MAC Address</p>\\n<p>The Media Access Control Address (MAC) is also known as the hardware address, which uniquely identifies network devices such as network cards and routers.
