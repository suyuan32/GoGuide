If the DNS information for the domain name is not cached in the browser, the computer will check the system cache to see if there is any configuration in the Hosts file or cached information for the domain name. If it still doesn&#39;t exist, it will check the cache in the router.</li><li><strong>ISP cache</strong>: If there is no cache in the local DNS, it will enter the ISP&#39;s DNS cache to search. Internet service providers usually cache some DNS information.</li><li><strong>Root domain server query</strong>: If the corresponding data is not found in the above two caches, a query request will be sent to the root server. If the domain name belongs to another top-level domain server, the root server will send the IP address of the top-level server to the client.
