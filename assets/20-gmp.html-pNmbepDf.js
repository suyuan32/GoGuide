Each P&#39;s local queue can hold up to 256 goroutines. When a new goroutine is created, it is initially placed in the local queue.

By default, Go sets a high limit (around 10,000), but in practice, the actual limit is effectively unlimited. An M needs to acquire a P to execute tasks. If no P is available, the M blocks. If a P&#39;s local queue is empty, the M fetches goroutines from the global queue.

Typically, it resides on the idle P list and is available for the scheduler, but it might be transitioning between other states. The <code>P</code> belongs to either the idle list or any other entity in transition to its state. Its run queue is empty.</td></tr><tr><td>_Prunning</td><td>1</td><td>Indicates that the <code>P</code> belongs to a specific <code>M</code> and is used for running user code or scheduling. Only the <code>M</code> that owns this <code>P</code> is allowed to change the <code>P</code> from _Prunning. The <code>M</code> can transition the <code>P</code> to _Pidle (if there&#39;s no more work), _Psyscall (when entering a system call), or _Pgcstop (used for GC pauses). The <code>M</code> can also directly transfer ownership of the <code>P</code> to another <code>M</code> (e.g., for scheduling locked <code>G</code>s).</td></tr><tr><td>_Psyscall</td><td>2</td><td>Indicates that the <code>P</code> is currently not running user code. It has affinity with a specific <code>M</code> during system calls but is not owned by that <code>M</code> and can be preempted by other <code>M</code>s. Similar to _Pidle, but with lightweight transitions and maintained M affinity. Leaving _Psyscall must be done using CAS to allow preemption or reacquisition of the <code>P</code>. Note that there&#39;s an ABA risk: even if the <code>M</code> successfully CASes the original <code>P</code> back to _Prunning after a system call, it must understand that the <code>P</code> might have been used by other <code>M</code>s during this time.</td></tr><tr><td>_Pgcstop</td><td>3</td><td>Indicates that the <code>P</code> has stopped for STW (stop-the-world) and is owned by an M in the stop world. The M in the stop world continues to use its P, even during _Pgcstop. Transitioning from _Prunning to _Pgcstop causes the M to release its P and go to sleep. The P retains its run queue, and startTheWorld will restart the scheduler on a P with a non-empty run queue.</td></tr><tr><td>_Pdead</td><td>4</td><td>Indicates that the <code>P</code> is no longer in use (due to decreasing GOMAXPROCS). If GOMAXPROCS increases, we reuse the P. Most resources associated with the dead P are reclaimed, although some resources (such as trace buffers) are still retained.</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="hint-container important"><p class="hint-container-title">Scheduler Strategies</p><table><thead><tr><th>Strategy</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Preemptive Scheduling</td><td>In goroutines, a goroutine must voluntarily yield the CPU for the next goroutine to use it. Goroutines in Go are limited to using the CPU for a maximum of 10ms, after which they are preempted to allow other goroutines to run. This prevents any single goroutine from monopolizing the CPU for an extended period.</td></tr><tr><td>Thread Reuse</td><td>Go&#39;s scheduler reuses threads instead of creating new ones each time. This reduces the overhead of thread creation and destruction, improving performance. <br>- <strong>Work Stealing</strong>: When an <code>M</code> has no runnable <code>G</code>s, it tries to steal half of the <code>G</code>s from another <code>P</code>&#39;s local queue instead of destroying the <code>M</code>. <br>- <strong>Handoff Mechanism</strong>: When a <code>G</code> blocks due to a system call, the associated <code>M</code> releases its bound <code>P</code> for other <code>M</code>s to use.</td></tr><tr><td>Parallelism</td><td>By configuring the number of <code>P</code>s using <code>GOMAXPROCS</code>, Go achieves parallel execution. The number of <code>P</code>s determines the degree of parallelism, and setting it equal to the number of CPU cores achieves maximum parallelism.</td></tr><tr><td>Global Queue</td><td>When there is no executable <code>G</code> in the local queue, <code>M</code> will first go to the global queue to try to obtain <code>G</code>. If there is no <code>G</code> to be run in the global queue, <code>M</code> will try to steal it from the local queue of other <code>P</code> to take <code>G</code></td></tr></tbody></table></div>',8),w=o('<h3 id="gmp-scheduling-flow" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gmp-scheduling-flow"><span>GMP Scheduling Flow</span></a></h3><figure><img src="'+s+'" alt="schedule" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>schedule</figcaption></figure><div class="hint-container info"><p class="hint-container-title">Goroutine Scheduling Flow</p><ol><li><strong>Creating a <code>G</code></strong>: <ul><li>If the local queue is not full, a newly created <code>G</code> is randomly placed in an unfilled local queue.
